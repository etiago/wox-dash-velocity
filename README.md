# Wox-Dash-Velocity

macOS users have been enjoying Alfred to Dash integration for ages whilst Windows users have been pestered by their additional ALT+TAB

Well, no more!

Wox users on Windows can now also enjoy integration with Velocity with this lovely plugin.

Just install and use as such: ```dash [optional-docset-name:] search query```.

Here it is in action:
