# Wox-Dash-Velocity

macOS users have been enjoying Alfred to Dash integration for ages whilst Windows users have been pestered by their additional ALT+TAB
to switch to the Windows equivalent - [Velocity](https://velocity.silverlakesoftware.com/) (if you don't have it yet, get it now! It uses exactly the same docsets as Alfred).

Well, no more!

Wox users on Windows can now also enjoy integration with [Velocity](https://velocity.silverlakesoftware.com/). with this lovely plugin.

Just install and use as such: ```dash [optional-docset-name:] search query```.

Kudos to [@jamiedasilva](https://twitter.com/jamiedasilva) for making Velocity. I only made the integration with Wox.

Here it is in action:
